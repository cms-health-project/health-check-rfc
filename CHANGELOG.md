# 0.x

* 0.0.x
  * Using an enum for the `component type` property of the `Check Result`
    entity showed as not suitable, as these value needs to be free to
    choose. Therefore, the enum class is removed and the interface return
    type to `string`.

* 0.0.1
  * Implement first round if interfaces and enum to pave the way
    for discussions and early POC implementations
